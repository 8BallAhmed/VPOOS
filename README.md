# Vehicle Parts Online Ordering System (VPOOS)

VPOOS is a vehicle parts ordering system, which is developed to make the  ordering of car parts easier, without the usual fuss of going to an official distributor and ordering parts.



## Tools used

This project uses **Express.js** for server development and setting up the endpoints, as well as **Sequelize** to connect to the database. For the front-end, this project uses **React Native**, as well as **react-spring** for animation, and **react-native-linear-gradient** for card design. **React Navigation** is also used to navigate between screens.

## Installation

You can install the dependencies of this project using Node Package Manager, which comes packaged with Node.js. To download and Install Node, navigate to the following [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Navigate to either Frontend or Backend folders, and run the following:

```bash
npm install
```


This installs the dependencies.

## Backend usage
